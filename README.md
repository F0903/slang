# Slang

A WIP simple custom scripting language called Slang (*s*imple-*lang*uage), using a bytecode interpreter.
Written to learn the workings behind interpreted languages.

For language syntax see syntax.ebnf or the test.slang file (may not be complete or updated)

Compiler and VM based on those from clox in the fantastic book ["Crafting Interpreters"](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
