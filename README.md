# Slang

A WIP simple custom scripting language called Slang (*s*imple-*lang*uage), using a bytecode interpreter.
Written to learn the workings behind interpreters and such.

For language syntax see syntax.ebnf or the test.slang file

Based on the interpreter from the amazing book "Crafting Interpreters".
