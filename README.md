# Slang

A WIP simple scripting language called Slang (*s*imple-*lang*uage), using a bytecode interpreter.
Written to learn the workings behind interpreted languages.

For language syntax see syntax.ebnf  or the test.slang file (may not be complete or updated as of writing)

The inner workings of the language is based on clox in the fantastic book ["Crafting Interpreters"](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
