# TODO

Current chapter: <https://craftinginterpreters.com/closures.html>

- Finish basic rough implementation through the book.
- Have a look at the Object representation again to reduce copying (even if it's still somewhat small structs, it's still more than an 8 byte pointer).
- String interpolation.
- Const "variables"
- Better error handling.
- Language test suite.
